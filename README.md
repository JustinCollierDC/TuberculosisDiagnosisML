# Business Model
We have developed an intuitive system that can use Machine Learning to assist Hospital 
Emergency Rooms with screening a visiting patient’s respiratory symptoms and identify whether 
they are currently suffering from Tuberculosis. This system is expected to have a huge practical 
use during Cold and Flu seasons when symptoms often overlap with one another, and Hospitals 
experience a lot of additional congestion in wait rooms from these less serious illnesses. 
Our system aims to improve the productivity of doctors and hospital staff by helping to 
separate those with signs of Tuberculosis from those simply suffering from a cold or flu, allowing 
them to be prioritized or directed to a specialist. The risks that come with false positives in our 
current system are low as the patient will not be informed of our system's deduction, rather the 
system will flag them and notify hospital staff of the Tuberculosis prediction. If it is a false positive, 
the examiner will determine during the examination and proceed as they would with any other 
patient.
We also believe that this system, with further funding, could be replicated and redeveloped 
at lower costs to cover other respiratory ailments or even help with future respiratory pandemics 
when hospital congestion is at a global high.

# Problem Statement 
Motivation 
The average wait time for assessment by a doctor in the ER was 2.1 hours as of Dec 2023. In comparison 
the average total stay for low-urgency patients was 3.3 hours.
Scope of the Project 
Our ML system will give doctors a tool that can effectively speed up assessments through predictive 
diagnosis, giving doctors information to work off and redirecting patients to needed specialists 
faster.We are not aiming to replace doctors, instead we want
to provide "a second brain" that can speed up their work without compromising the safety of 
patients.Our ML system will give doctors a tool that can effectively speed up assessments 
through predictive diagnosis.

The focus is on providing an accessible and accurate tool for doctors to aid in TB detection.

# Our Vision:
The Vision of our project is to harness the ability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine 
Learning (ML) to revolutionize the diagnosis and way of treatment of Tuberculosis (TB). By 
applying advanced diagnostic models and algorithms, the project aims to significantly improve the 
efficiency and accuracy of TB detection, particularly in high-burden regions and low-resource 
settings. The goal is to contribute to the global fight against TB by making early and accurate 
diagnosis accessible to all, thereby reducing the disease's prevalence and mortality rates.
• Strategic Partnerships: Forming alliances with organizations and health entities to 
facilitate the adoption of AI in TB diagnosis, like the collaboration between Siemens 
Healthiness and the Global Fund.
• Product Development: Continuously improving and validating machine learning models 
to maintain high sensitivity and specificity in TB detection.
• Market Penetration and Expansion: Increasing market share by providing cost-effective 
TB screening solutions and expanding the product line to include novel machine learning 
approaches for TB segmentation and prediction.
• Innovation: Emphasizing the importance of innovation in business to adapt and 
overcome challenges, thereby distinguishing the product from competitors.
• Internal Growth: Optimizing internal business processes to increase revenue and 
customer acquisition.

Overall, through strategic growth, innovation, and a focus on long-term objectives, the 
project aims to achieve a significant market position and contribute to the global fight against TB.
